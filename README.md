## Abstract
Automating fruit sorting is difficult because produce
varies so much in appearance and datasets are rarely balanced.
Existing solutions tend to focus on solving each of these problems,
which affects the overall efficiency of the system.This paper
proposes a dual-stage framework based deep learning system
for the integration of these two tasks. For classification of six
fruit categories in the FruitNet dataset, a ConvNeXt-Tiny model
pretrained on ImageNet is used, and an EfficientNetV2-B0 model
that has undergone same-domain transfer learning is used for
quality level grading (good, average, poor).Standard geometric
augmentations and class-weighted loss functions are applied to
mitigate class imbalance and enhance robustness.With a solid
F1-score of 95.6%, the system proves reliable enough for real
world use on edge devices, the proposed system is superior
to the existing approaches.Mostly, the suggested modular and
lightweight architecture showcases the practicality of instant fruit
evaluation on underpowered gadgets as a first important move
for extending agricultural automation.
